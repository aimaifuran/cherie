           <center> <img src="rizal.jpg" alt="Jose Rizal Portrait"></center>
            <p>José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda, commonly known as Dr. José Rizal, was a Filipino nationalist, writer, and revolutionary who became a central figure in the Philippine fight for independence against Spanish colonization. Born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Rizal was the seventh of eleven children in a well-off family. From an early age, he displayed an exceptional intellect and a deep love for learning, mastering multiple languages and excelling in various fields such as literature, medicine, and philosophy.</p>
            <p>Rizal's most notable works, <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>, exposed the abuses and corruption of Spanish officials and clergy in the Philippines. These novels awakened a sense of nationalism among Filipinos and inspired many to fight for freedom and equality. However, his writings also made him a target of Spanish authorities, who considered him a threat to their rule.</p>
            <p>Despite his peaceful advocacy for reform, Rizal was implicated in the revolutionary activities of the Katipunan, a movement fighting for Philippine independence. Arrested and falsely accused of sedition, he was exiled to Dapitan in Mindanao and later executed by firing squad on December 30, 1896, at Bagumbayan (now Rizal Park) in Manila. His death marked a turning point in the Philippine Revolution and solidified his legacy as a national hero and symbol of Filipino resistance against oppression.</p>
            <p>Rizal's life and works continue to inspire Filipinos to this day, emphasizing the importance of education, patriotism, and the pursuit of justice.</p>

            <h2><center>Life of Jose Rizal</center></h2>
            
            <p>José Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, to a wealthy and well-educated family. He was the seventh of eleven children of Francisco Mercado Rizal and Teodora Alonso Realonda. From a young age, Rizal displayed remarkable intelligence, creativity, and a love for learning, which shaped him into a polymath and a leader of his time.</p>
            <p><strong>Early Education and Studies:</strong> Rizal began his early education in Calamba and Biñan. At just 16, he enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, where he earned high honors and showed great aptitude for literature and languages. He later studied medicine at the University of Santo Tomas but transferred to Europe to further his studies. He completed his medical degree and specialized in ophthalmology at the University of Madrid in 1885.</p>
            <p><strong>Life in Europe and Literary Works:</strong> While living in Europe, Rizal immersed himself in liberal and nationalist ideas. He became fluent in multiple languages and developed a deep understanding of the injustices faced by Filipinos under Spanish colonial rule. It was during this period that he wrote his famous novels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Noli Me Tangere" (1887)</strong> - a bold work exposing the abuses of Spanish friars and officials.</li>
                <li><strong>"El Filibusterismo" (1891)</strong> - a darker sequel that called for reform and depicted the struggles of the oppressed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These writings stirred nationalist sentiments among Filipinos and angered the Spanish authorities, who viewed him as a threat to their power.</p>
            <p><strong>Return to the Philippines and Exile:</strong> Rizal returned to the Philippines in 1892, hoping for peaceful reform. He founded the La Liga Filipina, a civic organization advocating for unity, education, and peaceful reform. However, Spanish authorities saw him as a danger and exiled him to Dapitan, a remote town in Mindanao. During his exile, Rizal continued his work as a physician, teacher, and community leader, improving the lives of locals.</p>
            <p><strong>Arrest, Trial, and Execution:</strong> In 1896, the Philippine Revolution broke out, and although Rizal did not support armed rebellion, he was arrested and accused of sedition. After a mock trial, Rizal was sentenced to death. On December 30, 1896, at Bagumbayan (now Rizal Park), José Rizal was executed by firing squad. As he faced death, he demonstrated immense courage, leaving behind his final poem, "Mi Último Adiós" (My Last Farewell).</p>
