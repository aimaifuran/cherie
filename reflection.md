# Reflection

Setting up my Django environment was a valuable learning experience. Initially, I encountered an issue because Python was not installed on my system. After downloading Python from the official website and ensuring it was added to my PATH, I was able to proceed. Creating and activating a virtual environment was straightforward, but I had to double-check that I was using the correct version of Python. Installing Django with pip worked smoothly, but I ran into an error when trying to run the development server because I forgot to activate the virtual environment. Once I activated it, the server started without issues.

Configuring Git was another challenge. I had never set up a remote repository before, so I followed online tutorials to create a GitHub repo and connect it using `git remote add origin`. Pushing my code required me to generate an SSH key and add it to my GitHub account. Through these steps, I learned the importance of reading documentation and troubleshooting errors. Overall, the process improved my confidence in managing development environments.
